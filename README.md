RELEX Monitoring API demo application
=====================================

This repository contains a demo application showing code examples of how 
RELEX customers can interact with the [RELEX Monitoring API][1]. 

The application is not expected to be run as-is, it is rather provided as a code sample.

## Current examples

* Accessing file events endpoint to check file upload status.
* Verifying that important files have been processed by RELEX.

The demo application currently focuses on the File events endpoint.
Examples for Job events will be added in the future.
